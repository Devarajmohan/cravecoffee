### Key Challenges
1. **Non-Responsive Website** – The website was not responsive across devices, which led to poor usability on mobile and tablet screens.  
2. **Low SEO Visibility** – The site had low search engine visibility due to weak SEO foundations.  
3. **Outdated User Experience** – Browsing, engagement, and conversion rates were negatively affected.  
4. **Slow Loading Times** – Users exited before completing actions like viewing products or sending inquiries.  

**Business Problem:**  
The goal was not only to redesign the UI but to build a modern platform that supported **branding, customer engagement, and measurable growth in digital traffic**.


**Target Users:** 
The platform was designed for:

- ✔ **Mobile-first customers** searching on phones and tablets

The stack was chosen for **maintainability, high performance, and faster delivery**.


**Main Challenge:** 
The biggest challenge was improving:

—all at the same time while keeping development fast and the site easy for clients to maintain.
